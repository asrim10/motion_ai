Motion: Local-First AI Productivity Platform 
Motion is a next-generation, unified mobile productivity platform designed to eliminate tool fragmentation. Built with an "Offline-First" architecture, it seamlessly captures meeting notes, voice recordings, tasks, and visual diagrams, and uses Vector Search AI to enable powerful semantic information retrieval, even when you're offline.✨ FeaturesMotion is designed to transform unstructured meeting data into structured, actionable knowledge.Local-First Architecture: Ensures full Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) functionality and sub-100ms load times, regardless of internet connectivity, using Isar Database.Semantic Search (AI-Powered): Go beyond keyword matching. Utilize MongoDB Atlas Vector Search to query your notes based on meaning and context, finding concepts even if you use different words.Meeting Intelligence: Auto-syncs with your calendar, creates pre-populated meeting workspaces, and handles real-time voice transcription.Voice-to-Task Automation: Integrated Speech-to-Text (STT) and an integrated LLM automatically generates concise summaries and extracts "To-Do" action items directly from audio.Whiteboard Engine: A vector-based drawing canvas allows for editable diagrams and flowcharts to be stored alongside your notes.Cross-Platform Consistency: Developed entirely with Flutter, providing a native-like experience on both iOS and Android from a single codebase.📸 MockupsVisualizing the integrated workflow—from recording to intelligent retrieval.Meeting Workspace (Recording)Note Review & AI SummarySemantic Search Interface📦 Getting StartedThese instructions assume you have Flutter set up.PrerequisitesFlutter SDK: Stable channel (3.x or newer). Install FlutterIDE: VS Code or Android Studio with Flutter/Dart extensions.InstallationClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-username]/motion_app_v1.git
Navigate to the project directory:cd motion_app_v1
Install dependencies (Isar code generation required):flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
Database Setup: Motion requires a MongoDB Atlas connection string and potentially an API key for the external transcription service.Create a file named .env in the root directory and add your keys (e.g., MONGO_URI, WHISPER_API_KEY).Running the AppRun the app on your connected device or simulator:flutter run
🛠️ Built WithFlutter - The UI toolkit for cross-platform development.Dart - The programming language.Isar Database - High-performance local NoSQL database for the "Local-First" architecture.MongoDB Atlas - Cloud database supporting the flexible BSON structure and Vector Search capabilities.[State Management Package] - (e.g., Riverpod or Bloc for MVVM implementation).[External AI Service] - (e.g., Whisper API for high-fidelity transcription).🤝 ContributingWe welcome contributions to Motion!
